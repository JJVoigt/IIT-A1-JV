      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">What is the project?</h1>
      <p>In a time where we must remember many passwords and cracking passwords is quite common, managing the passwords of these accounts is of utmost importance. 
	      Thus, using a Raspberry Pi as a portable password manager, generator and encrypted storage allows the owner to remember one password in order to access all their other ones simultaneously. 
	      It could be used by the everyday person to allow them to safely store encrypted passwords.
	      It also will feature a password strength analyser and generator and encrypt the new password into a Graphics User Interface (GUI) file that is locked by a password.
	      The list of passwords will then be stored on a self-made cloud making for easy access on any other device. </p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">How is it useful?</h1>
      <p>

The project is useful as people have various accounts, on many different applications and services, and remembering then all can be quite difficult especially if they are long passwords that are hard to crack. 
	      Raspberry Pi technology is a cheap and easily assembled solution to this problem. 
	      It is useful as using a Raspberry Pi it will be a portable password manager that one can use in everyday life and keep with them when need be. 
	      The cloud technology amplifies this as it can be accessed from any device, anywhere. In Australia 68.5% of passwords can be cracked in less than a second. (Australian Cyber Security Magazine, 2021).
	      Thus, this device will make it less likely as it is more efficient at creating and storing passwords. 
	      In a Verizon breach it was found that 37% of credential theft used stolen or weak credentials. (Verizon, 2020). 
	      Thus, this device will ensure passwords are strong and cannot be cracked easily.

      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Description of the project</h1>
      <p>Physically the device will be a simple Raspberry Pi 4b with a case and a touch screen as well as some buttons. 
	      To the actual software, the first GUI will feature two option the first is to allow the user to setup and email and phone verification to access the cloud storage. 
	      The second being a simple GUI that allows a given person to enter the site or application they need the password for, as well as the password itself. 
	      It will also have the option to generate a strong password by clicking generate password button next to the input password area. 
	      Once they have decided on a password, they may choose to press the analyse password button in which the password will be placed against criteria to determine if it is safe. 
	      If they choose not to analyse the password when they attempt to save the password it will be analysed, and a warning will pop up if the password is weak.</p>
	  
	  <p>Once the password is strong it will be encrypted and sent to another file GUI that will have a list of the site or applications that the given person has entered and the corresponding passwords next to it. 
		  The GUI will implement basic graphics components and buttons to press as well as sections to take input. 
		  It will be an approximate height that will feel comfortable on all screen sizes and feature a blue aesthetic. 
		  The saved password file GUI will have the option to delete passwords from the given list. <p>
	  
	  <p> 
	  The Raspberry Pi would also be connected to a small touch screen that allows for quick access to the stored passwords.
		  Given the user enters their password to access the encrypted data. 
		  Thus, the project will require physical buttons and another simple GUI in order to achieve said goals. 
		  This GUI would be very simple text with a keyboard layout to input the password to increase usability of the device.
		  Additionally, a mouse could be plugged in to input the required password. 
		  A little control stick would be used as an immediate alternative so that the user could use the stick to select characters on the screen for their password and wouldnâ€™t require a mouse. <p>
	  
	  <p>The product would also provide cloud storage for the passwords to be accessed anywhere. 
		  This would include the previous mentioned GUI for the storage of passwords.
		  This would also alert the user and email them if the cloud storage has been accessed by an unknown entity.
		  And would contain information of the Ip that accessed the server.
		  As security is the whole point of the project it would also include an email or phone verification in order to access the cloud for an extra layer of security, in which the user would be sent an 8 digit code and have to input it into a GUI, in addition to their password in order to access their list of applications and corresponding passwords.

      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Hardware and software required</h1>
      <p>
In order to complete this project, the base hardware needed is a Raspberry Pi 4b with Python.
	      A Raspberry Pi is a minicomputer that what is that can do anything a standard computer can do. 
	      It is often used for projects that interact with the outside world such as an infrared camera. (Raspberry Pi, 2022). 
	      On the other hand, Python is an object orientated programming language that allows the user to build software, websites and other applications. (Coursera, 2022).
	      In addition to Python the Cryptography package is also needed for coding the encryption. (PyPi, 2022).  
	      Owncloud is needed for hosting cloud storage in addition to a web server application and PHP a server-side scripting language as well as SQLite. (Ionos, 2022).
	      Others can be used for a more complex build but sticking with these will make for an easier to run the cloud. 
	      Likewise, the verifying phone and email can become very complex but with the email-verifier and Django-phone-verify package, it can be simplified to a manageable task via the Twilio SMS service. (Twilio, 2022).
	      Subsequently, both the Raspberry Pi and Python and packages are needed to implement all aspects of this project. <p>

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Skills required</h1>
      <p>
The skills for this project are based around basic coding in Python.
	      Getting a handle of coding GUI as well as password generator, analyser and encryptor.
	      It is very feasible to find these skills and software as there are many tutorials and online forums that provide up to date information on how to code.
	      More specifically how to code the aforementioned aspects of the project. 
	      The skills required also include setting up the Raspberry Pi, which is straight forward and again, has many tutorials online that explain how to do so. The cloud storage can be a lot more complex but with the right tools such as Owncloud, PHP and SQLite there is only basic coding needed. 
	      When coding the email and phone verifier, verification packages such as Django-phone-verify and email-verifier are needed and coding becomes more complex but again, there are many instances of tutorials online on how to do this making it very accessible and feasible.<p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">If successful what are the outcomes?</h1>
      <p>If successful the average person will have access to an easy to use, portable password manager that will allow them to safely store their passwords.
	      This will partially solve the problem of cracking passwords as not only will these passwords be stored safely, but they will also be strong passwords that are hard to crack. 
	      The impact would be that less people are forgetting their passwords or getting their passwords stolen thus, less loss of accounts and money and a gain in efficiency in the workplace as less stolen data is apparent. 
	      The cloud storage will allow these passwords to be accessed from anywhere will encourage the user to use the device and reap the aforementioned benefits.<p>
