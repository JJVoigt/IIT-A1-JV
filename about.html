      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Interest in IT</h1>
      <p>My interest in IT would be programming, as I find it fascinating that you can write some code and produce even simple output, or very complex applications. 
	  This interest started when I was 13 and a friend of mine told us we could remotely shut down classmatesâ€™ computers using cmd. 
	  This then progressed to wanting to learn programming so when I was 14. 
	  I proceeded to order the C++ for dummies book and learnt some basic concepts of coding. In turn I was fuelled to study IT units (1 and 2) and (3 and 4) in high school which I learnt some basic excel and website building tools. I also studied certificate 3 in digital media and information technology which I thoroughly enjoyed.
	  I decided another career direction back then thus do not have any more IT experience but plan on starting with Introduction to Information Technology (IIT) and Introduction to Programming (ITP) and then the Bachelor of IT.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">Why I chose to study at RMIT</h1>
      <p>I chose to come to RMIT because it is a reputable, high performing university that offers Bachelor of IT through Open Universities. 
	  This partnership offers a perfect course that can be studied online with the convenience of studying anywhere. 
	  It provides high quality teaching and support for students. The values of from diversity and inclusion to sustainability are of utmost importance and resound with my personal values.
	  This proven track record of being third globally in 2021 Times higher Education Impact Rankings boasts and impressive result. 
	  More specifically their reputation in computer science and information systems, being 10th in Australia for QS Rankings by Subject 2021.(RMIT, 2022).
	  Furthermore, a combination of the aforementioned traits of RMIT make it a great place to study, develop and learn.</p>

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-blue">What do you expect to learn?</h1>
      <p>In general, I expect to learn what is contained in the course as I have a great interest in IT. I expect to learn about the different fields in I.T as well as software, application, and job skills that I will need upon graduation to enter the IT market. 
	  More specifically, this course aligns with my short-term goal of getting into the Bachelor or IT and midterm of getting an IT job. Thus, I expect to learn basic concepts of contemporary technologies as well as the social context of said technologies. 
	  The legal aspects of IT and specifically a product idea. To learn how to work in a team during the production of a product and create and effective team environment. Lastly, prepare comprehensive written it reports. (RMIT, 2022). 
	  Moreover, the skills I would like to learn in this course would ideally be applicable to the current IT job environment and compliment the other units of study.</p>
